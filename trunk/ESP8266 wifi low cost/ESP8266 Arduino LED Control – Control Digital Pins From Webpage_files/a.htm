Elementary to you I'm sure but I'm a bit confused, because I've seen others ask questions about the syntax of a sendData statement in other sketchs and situations. In one of your videos you said that you created a sendData function. Yours has 3 parameters. Am i correct thinking from that you defined this function? Is it part of any library, (like the Softwareserial library, or can a sendData function be created in any sketch, and parameters defined when the function is created? I ask because I am trying to learn how to interact with the 8266 and arduino over a web access.I can successfully turn on and off led's but I noticed some querky actions, and not sure where the issues are. (Right now I'm only working within my own LAN)  For example, If I click a button (say Pin11) and the led turns on, and I then click it again too soon the function for that button seems to hang. If I click another button in the meantime, (say Pin 12) that one responds. Sooner or later the Pin11 will react again. It all seems that something in the firmware of the 8266 is stuck in some kind of loop or wait state, but only for the particular button \"double\" clicked. Then finally comes back to life.

<p>Hello,</p><p> I am trying the ' ESP8266 Arduino LED Control (Control 
The Digital Pins Via WiFi, Send Data From Webpage to Arduino) ' on 
Arduino MEGA2560 ; But it aint working.</p><p>Can you please tell me the connections of MEGA with ESP to perform the above project.</p><p>I am stuck in three ways</p><p>1. When i connect the TX of ESP to the RX(pin 0) of MEGA and Rx to TX(pin 1) of MEGA, the code doesn't upload. NO LED TOGGLE</p><p>2.
 When i connect the TX of ESP to the TX(pin 1) of MEGA and Rx to RX(pin 
0) of MEGA, only then does the code upload, BUT no output on the serial 
monitor.NO LED TOGGLE</p><p>3. Then i connected the RX and TX pin of ESP
 to the pin 10 and 11 of the MEGA (PWM), Code Uploads and There is 
output on the serial monitor of all the AT Commands. But no '+IPD' 
output and NO LED TOGGLE.</p><p>Please help.</p><p>Thanx alot for the video too.</p>

<p>Hello Miguel, I have a question about the sendData function. 
Elementary to you I'm sure but I'm a bit confused, because I've seen 
others ask questions about the syntax of a sendData statement in other 
sketchs and situations. In one of your videos you said that you created a
 sendData function. Yours has 3 parameters. Am i correct thinking from 
that you defined this function? Is it part of any library, (like the 
Softwareserial library, or can a sendData function be created in any 
sketch, and parameters defined when the function is created? I ask 
because I am trying to learn how to interact with the 8266 and arduino 
over a web access.I can successfully turn on and off led's but I noticed
 some querky actions, and not sure where the issues are. (Right now I'm 
only working within my own LAN)  For example, If I click a button (say 
Pin11) and the led turns on, and I then click it again too soon the 
function for that button seems to hang. If I click another button in the
 meantime, (say Pin 12) that one responds. Sooner or later the Pin11 
will react again. It all seems that something in the firmware of the 
8266 is stuck in some kind of loop or wait state, but only for the 
particular button "double" clicked. Then finally comes back to life. 
Thanks again for great videos!</p>

<p>Thanks Miguel,<br>OK, so I'm using your sketch, and it looks like 
it's being closed on line 54, so are you saying that we must wait for 
the esp to process that before we can send another command? After each 
button click I do see a mutilated message back on the serial monitor 
such as:</p><p>HTTP/1.1<br>Host: 192.168.4.1<br>Connection: keeAT+CIPCLOSE=0<br>OK<br>Unlink</p><p>As soon as I see that if I click a button again, things seem to stay orderly.</p>

<p>Yes, unfortunately the ESP is probably very slow to receive data, 
send it to the Arduino, receive a reply, and respond back to the web 
browser. Another user who was having similar issues told me he updated 
the firmware and the ESP was hanging less know and giving him less 
issues overall.</p>

<p>Hey flagtrax, I have the exact same problem. If I double click on the
 buttons I sometimes get the full message, If I click only once, I get 
the mutilated message. And I gotta say that the LED states don't toggle.
 They stay High after first toggle.</p>

<p>Since we can't see inside the 8266 at this point, It's hard to tell 
what's going on there. As Miguel says though, the Esp has to do what it 
does and then close the connection. I have played with this situation a 
lot and watched the timing and I think even if some kind of ack was sent
 and detected, it probably wouldn't shorten the timing. The thing then 
to do is block another request from being sent until an ack is received 
to the sending web page/site. Since I am not HTML or PHP or JAVA, savy, I
 don't yet know how to do that.  Right now I'm trying to learn Arduino 
along with C++, and all the above. Keep in mine my expertise spawns from
 the days of assembly language for the 8080 circa 1970's lol</p>

<p>Alternatively you could setup another flag in the Arduino code that 
will tell it to wait until it sends the CIPCLOSE of the previous 
connection before it starts sending data to a new one.</p>

<p>I'm thinking we could set up a flag in JQuery that disables the 
webpage buttons until the Arduino replies back with a message saying 
that it's ready for the next request. Something like what I do in my 
ESP8266 Android app where I display a dialog message until the request 
is processed.</p><p><a href="http://allaboutee.com/2015/01/20/esp8266-android-application-for-arduino-pin-control/" rel="nofollow">http://allaboutee.com/2015/01/...</a></p>

<p>That's the lines I was thinking on, Miguel. Unfortunately my level of
 expertise is about thumb nail high when it comes to java and it's 
implementation. Since discovering the arduino platform (a late commer 
for sure) it has been kind of like learning as you go. By the way, 
thanks for the links to W3S! Working on HTML now! Maybe someday I'll 
catch up  :P</p>

<p>OK, I don't know where to go from here, I have all things set up, 
arduino sketch loaded, HTML page in place in the browser, but nothing 
happens. With the serial monitor open I can see the commands sent and 
responded to while initializing, but clicking a button does nothing. I 
verified that I am connected to the esp when viewing the network 
connection. How do I find out where it's going wrong? Thanks for great 
work.</p>

<p>Hi Miguel, thanks for the reply. Yes all that was done as you state. I
 did however find the problem, it was operator error. When I copyed the 
java script I named it jquery.min and didn't append the .js to the end. 
Once that correction was made, it worked. There were a couple of quirks 
though.  First, I noticed that the illustration of the buttons above 
shows them placed vertically, while mine are horizontal. just curious on
 that since I know little about html. Secondly the commands seem to 
"bottleneck" somewhere in the system. by that I mean; when I click a 
button,  if I don't wait at least a couple of seconds, and click another
 the arduino doesn't react for sometimes up to minutes. At first I 
thought something was wrong and reset everything. Then once I walked 
away and came back to find the led had changed states. I could turn on 
(say) pin 11, then try to turn it off, and nothing would happen. I would
 then turn  on  12 or 13 and that one would come on. Pin 12 still being 
unresponsive. I could even turn the other pins off and 12 would still 
not react. But eventually pin 12 would finally react to a command, as if
 it were "stuck" somewhere in the ESP or Arduino. I also noticed 
watching the serial monitor that the messages back from the ESP were 
being truncated and overwritten by the AT+CLOSE command.  Curious.... </p>

<p>In the video the buttons are placed vertically as well. In the illustration they are not because I added some <br> tags.</p><p>To
 prevent a bottleneck, instead of simply sending commands we should 
really have the code check to make sure we receive the expected message 
back from the ESP to make sure that it worked before we send the next 
command, I don't do this in the code.</p>

<p>Ahh, placement is not a big issue at this time just curious. I'm 
still not sure why the information sent to the serial monitor gets 
truncated by the CIPCLOSE command. Like this:</p><p>+IPD,0,290:GET /?pin=11 HTTP/1.1<br>Host: 192.168.4.1<br>Connection: keep-alive<br>Accept: */*<br>Origin: null<br>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrme400.21411 Sfai/3736<br>DT:1<br>Acep-Ecodng gip dflte sch<br>Acet-anuag: n-S,n;=08<br>O</p><p> HTTP/1.1<br>Host: 192.168.4.1<br>Connection: keeAT+CIPCLOSE=0<br>OK<br>Unlink<br> HTTP/1.1<br>Host: 192.168.4.1<br>Connection: keeAT+CIPCLOSE=0</p><p>OK</p><p>Unlink</p><p> HTTP/1.1</p><p>Host: 192.168.4.1</p><p>Connection: keeAT+CIPCLOSE=0</p><p>I
 thought it might have something to do with the serial monitor, so I 
tried to watch with "coolterm" but it wouldn't even recognize any of the
 characters coming in. Never used coolterm before, so I'm thinking that 
may be in the settings somewhere. At some point I'd like to try getting 
through the router as if I were in a remote location logged on to the 
internet via public access. Do any of your tutorials address that? 
Thanks again for the great help :)</p>

<p>That is because it's only 9600 baud, I think. You have to configure a
 higher baudrate. Send AT+CIOBAUD=19200, put esp8266.begin(19200) and 
configure serial monitor</p>
